When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would like to use a remote repository to mostly back up my work on github 
servers or collaborate with friends or collegues while working on a project.

I have the option to buy a subscription for a private repository on github to 
avoid public gists on valuable work. Since github offers free remote repositories
for opensource projects I'm most likely to use a remote repository for projects 
that don't have to deal with any proprietary code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically 
sync with my remote repository to avoid cluttering up my local repositories with 
unnecessary changes. 

It's considered best practice while using github to collaborate with others.
